Q. explain the concept of data types?
ans:


data types are basically used to define what is the type of a variable,

for example int, float, double, bool.

each data type uses a different memory, therefore we must define it.

for example char uses 1 byte,
int uses one byte,
double uses 8 bytes,
float uses 4 bytes
