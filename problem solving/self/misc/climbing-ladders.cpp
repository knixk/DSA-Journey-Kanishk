/*
Yeah bro, I got you â€” you're asking:

> **Why do we take `n - 1`, `n - 2`, and `n - 3` in `countWays(n)`?**

---

### ðŸªœ Imagine climbing a ladder with `n` steps

At **each point**, you're allowed to take either:
- 1 step,
- 2 steps, or
- 3 steps.

So, to reach the `n`th step:

- You couldâ€™ve been at **(n - 1)** and took **1 step**
- Or at **(n - 2)** and took **2 steps**
- Or at **(n - 3)** and took **3 steps**

---

### ðŸš€ So basically:

```cpp
countWays(n) = countWays(n - 1) + countWays(n - 2) + countWays(n - 3)
```

Youâ€™re **trying all 3 possible last moves**, and **adding up** the number of ways to reach those positions.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Example for `n = 4`:

- From step `3` â†’ take `+1` â†’ ways = `countWays(3)`
- From step `2` â†’ take `+2` â†’ ways = `countWays(2)`
- From step `1` â†’ take `+3` â†’ ways = `countWays(1)`

So, total = `countWays(3) + countWays(2) + countWays(1)`

---

Let me know if you want a DP version of this for faster results ðŸš€
